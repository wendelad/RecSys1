#MyMediaLite item recommendation tool: --rating-threshold=4 interprets all ratings > 4 as positive feedback

If you are a Java developer, this may help you to learn about C#: http://www.25hoursaday.com/CsharpVsJava.html

How to call #MyMediaLite from F#: https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite/blob/master/examples/fsharp/item_recommendation.fs https://github.com/zenogantner/MyMediaLite/blob/master/examples/fsharp/rating_prediction.fs #recsys

#MyMediaLite has a Java port: https://github.com/jcnewell/MyMediaLiteJava initiated by @JCWNewell #recsys

To do rating prediction w/o evaluation, just provide --test-file and --prediction-file as command-line arguments.

To do item recommendation w/o evaluation, just provide --prediction-file as command-line argument.

For item recommendation, you can fine-tune what you want to predict with --predict-items-number=N --repeated-items --candidate-items. etc.
