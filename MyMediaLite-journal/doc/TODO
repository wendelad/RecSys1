Recommender functionality
 - additional recommenders
   - memory: just give out ratings in the training set, exception otherwise
   - non-negative matrix factorization
   - matrix factorization learned with alternating least squares/batch gradient descent
   - scalable/adaptive CF by Koren: http://research.yahoo.com/pub/2435
   - Improved Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~alexis/immmf.pdf
   - Hashing for CF: http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v9/karatzoglou10a/karatzoglou10a.pdf
   - attribute-based recommenders using LIBSVM
   - Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization http://www.mit.edu/~rsalakhu/BPMF.html
   - Content-boosted CF http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.73.8546&rep=rep1&type=pdf
   - restricted boltzmann machines
   - http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v11/seldin10a.html
   - Bell/Koren iCDM 2007 [SimuFctr]
 - time-aware rating and item prediction
   - timeSVD++
 - ensembles
   - ranking ensembles
   - stacking ensembles
   - ensembles for new users/new items
 - add more content-based routines (using Lemur?)
 - IItemRecommender: add CanPredict(user_id) method
 - evaluation
   - allow new user evaluation for item prediction
   - support different CV protocols: leave-one-out, leave-one-out-per-user, k-fold CV, chronological splits, user-/item-stratified CV
   - support evaluation protocols w/ repeated events
   - measure recommendation coverage
 - consider to store the hyperparameters in the model files as well
 - prediction certainty output
Architecture
 - tests/integration
   - test suite should also run for purely binary installation
 - web APIs
   - implement features similar to the Strands web service API or Hunch
   - http://drupal.org/project/recommender
   - generic API (implement RESTful using Manos):
     - add/remove feedback (user, item, type, score)
       - bulk version
     - remove user or item
     - get score for user/item combination
     - get top N recommendations for user
       - possibly filtered
       - possibly diversified
     - add user or item information (attributes etc.)
     - retrain (asynchronous)
 - internal APIs
   - user and item IDs could be unsigned integers instead of signed integers
   - generic optimization interface and algorithms (like Mallet)
 - recommenders 
   - add InitModel to ItemRecommender and RatingPredictor
   - regularization parameters: use logarithms instead of absolute values
   - nicer, more generic structure for kNN recommenders
     - non-weighted kNN
     - more correlation/similarity measures
       - rename to Similarity (instead of Correlation)?
     - combine arbitrary similarity matrices
     - user-defined similarities
 - distributed/parallel computing
   - GPU support
   - support for distributed computing

 - IO and storage
   - save model files using reflection (binary and XML)
   - GZip model files and prediction files (on demand)
 - try to run on JavaScript via https://github.com/kevingadd/JSIL
GUI demo
 - display a fixed number of movies on the screen, let the user browse
 - tabs
 - info panel (including movie poster, cast, etc.)
 - ability to switch between datasets
 - complete i18n
 - scale up to Netflix
 - store/load user data
 - faster IO
Misc features
 - command-line tools: standalone only for prediction based on model files
 - command-line tools: read from DB
 - command-line tools: time stats for CV
 - command-line tools: give out partial results for t-test etc.
 - rewrite MF techniques using vector/matrix abstractions
 - output a nice table format for evaluation w/ R etc.
Documentation/website
 - have documentation for different versions on the website
 - Doxygen: link to files on github/gitorious
 - add flyer to homepage (main page)
 - document attribute-aware recommenders: using and implementing
 - document using MyMediaLite from other languages, implementing recommenders in other languages
   - JavaScript -- https://github.com/fholm/IronJS/ -- wait until Mono 2.8 is more widely available
